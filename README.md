# Project: Heterogeneous Catalysis

A simple model for a catalyzed reaction with an intermediate species at a heterogenous interface is modeled in a 2-dimensional rectangular domain.
The model is implemented and solved numerically in a Pluto notebook. Version 1.8 of the Julia programming language was used with the Pluto package installed. In addition, the repository contains the current version of the project report where details regarding the project and references can be found.
